Overview




We have chosen this application because its logic offers a "rich testing ground" for applying multiple core software testing techniques.


The Simple Truecaller API simulates a real-world phone number identification service. It includes:
* User authentication

* Phone number lookup

* Spam reporting

________________




1. Phone Number Search
A search bar on the homepage allows any user to enter a phone number. The backend queries the database and returns the Owner Name, Carrier,
and Spam Status.


2. User Spam Reporting
Authenticated users can submit a report for a specific number, categorizing it (e.g., "Sales," "Scam") and adding a comment.






3. User Authentication & Rate Limiting
To prevent abuse (like scraping the whole database), api limits searches ("5 searches per hour").








________________


System Analysis


The Simple Truecaller API is a backend RESTful system that provides phone number identification and spam-reporting services. Clients interact with the system through HTTP requests and receive JSON responses. The system includes core components such as authentication, business logic, and database management.


   * Backend REST API providing caller identification services

   * Handles authentication, number lookup, and spam reporting

   * Uses token-based security for protected endpoints

   * Exchanges data using JSON over HTTP

   * Integrates API, service logic, and database layers

   * Designed for unit, integration, and system-level testing

Requirements Analysis
We have analyzed the Truecaller API Service and defined the following requirements. These define the "Contract" that the backend must fulfill, which will be validated via API testing.


Functional Requirements:


FR‑01  User Registration
        The system must allow a new user to register using a name and phone number.
FR‑02  User Login
        The system must allow users to log in using their registered phone number and receive an authentication token.
FR‑03  Phone Number Search
        Users must be able to search for any phone number through the API.
FR‑04  Return Caller Information
        When a number exists in the database, the system must return the owner's name,                                carrier information, and spam status.
FR‑05 Spam Reporting
        Authenticated users must be able to submit spam reports for any phone number, including category and comment.
FR‑06  Authorization Control
        The system must block all protected endpoints when used without a valid authentication token.
FR‑07  Rate Limiting
        The system must enforce search limits (e.g., max 5 searches per hour per user) to prevent abuse.
FR‑08  Duplicate Registration Prevention
        The system must not allow registering a phone number that already exists (return 409 Conflict).
FR‑09  Input Validation
        API must validate all inputs (empty or invalid formats return 400 Bad Request).
________________
Non‑Functional Requirements:
1. Performance Requirements
NFR‑P1: Average API response time must be ≤ 2 seconds under normal load.
NFR‑P2: 95% of all requests must respond within ≤ 1.5 seconds.
NFR‑P3: The system must handle 1000 requests per minute without failure.
NFR‑P4: Maximum CPU usage during peak load must remain below 80%.
NFR‑P5: Database query execution must not exceed 500 ms.


2. Reliability Requirements
NFR‑R1: System uptime must be ≥ 99% monthly.
NFR‑R2: System must handle at least 10,000 total records without data corruption.


3. Availability Requirements
NFR‑A1: API must be available 24/7 with no more than 7 hours of downtime per year.
NFR‑A2: Backup frequency must occur every 12 hours.


4. Scalability Requirements
NFR‑S1: System must support up to 10× traffic increase without architecture changes.
NFR‑S2: Database should support up to 100,000 records with no performance drop > 20%.


5. Security Requirements
NFR‑SEC1: Failed login attempts must be limited to 5 attempts per user per hour.
NFR‑SEC2: Password hashing must use a minimum SHA‑256 or stronger algorithm.
NFR‑SEC3: Token expiry time must be ≤ 24 hours.
NFR‑SEC4: System must block all inputs longer than 50 characters for phone fields.
NFR‑SEC5: All endpoints must enforce HTTPS with TLS 1.2 or higher.


6. Maintainability Requirements
NFR‑M1: New developers should understand system modules within ≤ 2 days of onboarding.
NFR‑M2: Fixing a critical bug should take ≤ 6 hours after detection.
NFR‑M3: Code duplication must be kept below 10%.
NFR‑M4: Automated tests must cover ≥ 70% of backend code.

TEST PLAN  



This document outlines the test plan for the Truecaller API Service, a simulated phone number identification . 


The purpose of this test plan is to ensure that all functional and non-functional requirements are validated through systematic testing, thereby guaranteeing the reliability, security, and performance of the application before deployment




 Test Strategy :
Methodology:
                1) Blackbox testing for API endpoints, Whitebox for unit tests
                2)Manual and automated functional tests
3)Integration testing between API and service layer and database



Testing Levels: 
        Unit Testing 
Integration Testing 
System Testing 
Acceptance Testing 


Test Environment : 
        Backend environment running the Simple Truecaller   API
Tools: Pytest
Test data: mock phone numbers and user accounts.


Test Schedule
Week 1: Requirements analysis
Week 2: Test plan creation and  Writing test cases
Week 3: Unit & integration testing and  Manual system testing
Week 4: Automation
Week 5: Bug fixing & final report
