1- Import problem accross dir:

        Python only searches for modules in directories listed in sys.path,
        which usually includes the current script’s folder but not its parent directories.


        When running pytest, the tests folder becomes the working directory, so Python can’t see modules in sibling folders like models.


        Adding __init__.py or modifying sys.path tells Python to treat the project as a package, allowing cross-folder imports.

2-how to create a venv with latest python version using git bash:

        py -3.13 -m venv testingenv313

        testingenv313/Scripts/activate

        python --version

        Python 3.13.2

3- Dealing with git tracking python cache files:

        just add dirname/pattern*  to gitignore file 

        ex:
                ignore/
                models/__*



4- Project Restructuring (Import Fixes):

        Moved "tests" -> "backend/true_caller_api/check_tests" so they are inside the Django project.
        Moved "models/account.py" out of root to avoid conflicts.
        Fixed import errors by organizing files where Python/Django expects them.

5- Environment Setup:

        Created "requirements.txt" with:
        django, djangorestframework, pytest, pytest-django.
        Run "pip install -r requirements.txt" to install them.

6- Pytest Configuration (pytest.ini):

        Created "backend/true_caller_api/pytest.ini".
        "DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE = true_caller_api.settings": Tells pytest which settings to use.
        "testpaths = check_tests": Tells pytest where to look for tests.
